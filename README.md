# üß† TADPOLE Challenge - Alzheimer's Disease Prediction

**The TADPOLE Challenge** (*Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution*) is a global initiative aimed at predicting future data for elderly individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, particularly participants from the [ADNI-3 study](http://adni3.org).

This challenge is organized by the [EuroPOND consortium](http://europond.eu) in collaboration with the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

## üìù Project Overview

This repository provides a solution for errors encountered while using the "TADPOLE_D1.m" and "TADPOLE_D2.m" MATLAB files, which are commonly used in conjunction with the TADPOLE Challenge datasets. If you experienced code issues in MATLAB when working with these files, this repository offers a fix.

### üîÑ Updates and Improvements

- The TADPOLE database has been **upgraded** to include **2021 CSV data**, improving upon the original 2017 TADPOLE Challenge database.
- This update helps to **better predict Alzheimer‚Äôs cases** by providing a more balanced and comprehensive dataset, leading to improved prediction accuracy.
- For more information take a look of the  Bachelor's Thesis: "Prediction of Alzheimer's vs. Dementia"[Bachelor's Thesis: "Prediction of Alzheimer's vs. Dementia] (https://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/handle/10486/698008/caba%C3%B1ero_fernandez_emilio.tfg.pdf?sequence=1) with the best results than the official challenge **mAUC = 0.935** and **BCA = 0.87**
